# AssemblyProject

This is a version of the Doodle Jump game using MIPS Assembly. It was made for the final assessment of CSC258 at the University of Toronto.

**Here's how you can play the game:**

1. Download MARS from the above repository. It has file name *Mars_Updated.jar*. You will need at least JDK 8 installed on your machine. MARS is a free IDE for MIPS Assembly programming, developed by [Kenneth Vollmar and Pete Sanderson](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/license.htm). The JAR file given here is patched by [Mustafa Quraish](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mustafa/) to fix issues with freezing.
